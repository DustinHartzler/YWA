1.0.0 - 2013-11-11 - Chris Jean
	iThemes Sync launch!
1.1.0 - 2013-11-20 - Chris Jean
	Enhancement: Added ability to handle desync user requests from the Sync server.
	Enhancement: Now avoids plugin conflicts that caused plugins and themes to not be properly reported and which prevented updates from being successfully applied.
	Enhancement: Now supports update reporting for and updating of plugins with updater code that only works with pre-3.0 versions of WordPress.
	Enhancement: Now supports sending local server status information back to the Sync server.
1.1.1 - 2013-11-20 - Chris Jean

1.1.2 - 2013-11-20 - Chris Jean
	Enhancement: By default, pulling update details will not force a flush of all the cached update data. Instead, this can now be specifically requested by the server.
1.1.3 - 2013-11-22 - Chris Jean
	Enhancement: The server will now receive a listing of the supported verbs with a status check. This will help the Sync Dashboard determine if the plugin needs to be upgraded in order to access specific features.

	Bug Fix: Removed call to the mysqli_get_server_info() function when pulling server details as it would trigger errors on some systems.

1.1.5 - 2013-12-02 - Chris Jean
	Bug Fix: Users that are not recognized by the Sync server can now be unsynced. This prevents the issue where users that are unsynced on the server when the site cannot be communicated with (or when the plugin is inactive) cannot be removed from the site.

	Bug Fix: Fixed issue that can cause failure to load plugin details on sites that have a different url and wpurl.

	Enhancement: Added the ability to manage plugins and themes.
	Enhancement: get-status requests now support variable display elements.

1.3.2 - 2014-02-18 - Chris Jean
	Enhancement: Adding ?ithemes-sync-force-display=1 to an admin page URL while logged in as a user that has manage-options privileges will force a site that has Sync hidden to display Sync temporarily for that user.
	Enhancement: Data sent back for update requests now includes more data to help identify systems that don't accurately report if the update was successful or not.
	Enhancement: Improved error messages for issues communicating with the Sync server.
	Enhancement: Added a compatibility check to ensure that Gravity Forms's updates are showing and able to be applied.
	Enhancement: Added checks to provide informational messages if more than one iThemes Sync plugin is active on a site.
	Enhancement: Improved styling of admin notices on the Settings > iThemes Sync page.
	Bug Fix: Increased the amount of time that the plugin will wait for responses from the Sync server when authenticating and deauthenting. This fixes the issue where some servers could not sync or unsync users due to server communication time outs.

	Enhancement: Improved feedback when installing themes and plugins.
	Enhancement: Added the ability to install and activate a plugin or theme in one request.
