1.0.0 - 2013-11-11 - Chris Jean
	iThemes Sync launch!
1.1.0 - 2013-11-20 - Chris Jean
	Enhancement: Added ability to handle desync user requests from the Sync server.
	Enhancement: Now avoids plugin conflicts that caused plugins and themes to not be properly reported and which prevented updates from being successfully applied.
	Enhancement: Now supports update reporting for and updating of plugins with updater code that only works with pre-3.0 versions of WordPress.
	Enhancement: Now supports sending local server status information back to the Sync server.
1.1.1 - 2013-11-20 - Chris Jean
	Bug Fix: Requests for the plugin settings would return the authentications data. Now, the authentications data must be explicitly requested in order to be retrieved.
1.1.2 - 2013-11-20 - Chris Jean
	Enhancement: By default, pulling update details will not force a flush of all the cached update data. Instead, this can now be specifically requested by the server.
1.1.3 - 2013-11-22 - Chris Jean
	Enhancement: The server will now receive a listing of the supported verbs with a status check. This will help the Sync Dashboard determine if the plugin needs to be upgraded in order to access specific features.
1.1.4 - 2013-11-26 - Chris Jean
	Bug Fix: Removed call to the mysqli_get_server_info() function when pulling server details as it would trigger errors on some systems.
	Bug Fix: Removed the /etc/passwd check when pulling server details. This was used to try to count the number of users on the system. It was removed since it triggered hacking attempt notices in the Wordfence plugin.
1.1.5 - 2013-12-02 - Chris Jean
	Bug Fix: Users that are not recognized by the Sync server can now be unsynced. This prevents the issue where users that are unsynced on the server when the site cannot be communicated with (or when the plugin is inactive) cannot be removed from the site.
1.1.6 - 2013-12-09 - Chris Jean
	Bug Fix: Fixed issue that can cause failure to load plugin details on sites that have a different url and wpurl.
1.1.7 - 2013-12-12 - Chris Jean
	Enhancement: Updated the styling to work better with WordPress 3.8.
1.1.8 - 2013-12-13 - Packaging Bot (lib/updater)
	Enhancement: Recently updated plugins and themes no longer report that an update is available.
	Enhancement: Added alternate line styling to the listings on the licensing page.
	Enhancement: Products with iThemes in the name will now properly capitalize the name.
	Enhancement: The updater and licensing system now handle iThemes server outages without causing long page delays or by reporting confusing error messages.
1.1.9 - 2013-12-13 - Chris Jean
	Enhancement: The Sync server can now create requests that force the iThemes updater system to refresh itself.
1.1.10 - 2013-12-16 - Chris Jean
	Enhancement: Added user security privileges when handling requests from the Sync server. This helps avoid issues with some security plugins.
1.1.11 - 2013-12-18 - Packaging Bot (lib/updater)
	Bug Fix: Removed unneeded check on package-info.ithemes.com which was causing performance issues on some sites.
1.1.12 - 2013-12-19 - Chris Jean
	Enhancement: Improved the get-status request so that the Sync server can request only the specific data it needs, causing less load and faster Sync responses.
1.1.13 - 2013-12-19 - Packaging Bot (lib/updater)
	Bug Fix: Licensing will now be universal across all sites of a multisite network. This means that you will only need to license on one site to have the license apply across the entire network.
1.2.0 - 2014-01-20 - Chris Jean
	Enhancement: Added the ability to manage plugins and themes.
	Enhancement: get-status requests now support variable display elements.
1.3.0 - 2014-01-29 - Chris Jean
	Enhancement: Added the ability to install plugins and themes.
	Bug Fix: Active plugins will be deactivated before uninstalling.
1.3.1 - 2014-02-03 - Packaging Bot (lib/updater)
	Bug Fix: Licensing on SSL-enabled sites now works properly.
1.3.2 - 2014-02-18 - Chris Jean
	Enhancement: Adding ?ithemes-sync-force-display=1 to an admin page URL while logged in as a user that has manage-options privileges will force a site that has Sync hidden to display Sync temporarily for that user.
	Enhancement: Data sent back for update requests now includes more data to help identify systems that don't accurately report if the update was successful or not.
	Enhancement: Improved error messages for issues communicating with the Sync server.
	Enhancement: Added a compatibility check to ensure that Gravity Forms's updates are showing and able to be applied.
	Enhancement: Added checks to provide informational messages if more than one iThemes Sync plugin is active on a site.
	Enhancement: Improved styling of admin notices on the Settings > iThemes Sync page.
	Bug Fix: Increased the amount of time that the plugin will wait for responses from the Sync server when authenticating and deauthenting. This fixes the issue where some servers could not sync or unsync users due to server communication time outs.
1.3.3 - 2014-02-19 - Chris Jean
	Bug Fix: Changed code that caused compatibility issues with some servers.
1.3.4 - 2014-02-21 - Chris Jean
	Bug Fix: Compatibility fix for plugins that corrupt the data sent back to the Sync server.
1.3.5 - 2014-03-07 - Chris Jean
	Enhancement: Valid requests from the Sync server will cause the plugin pretend to be an Administrator user. This is to avoid compatibility issues with some security plugins.
1.4.0 - 2014-03-28 - Chris Jean
	Bug Fix: Updating a WordPress multisite will now properly apply the network upgrade after updating.
	Enhancement: Users that are not recognized by the server are now identified on the Settings > iThemes Sync page.
	New Feature: Plugins and themes can now send notices to Sync. Details in api.txt.
1.4.1 - 2014-04-04 - Chris Jean
	Enhancement: The notice feature now supports more options, making it ready for use.
1.4.2 - 2014-04-15 - Chris Jean
	Enhancement: Made small adjustments to prepare for WordPress 3.9.
	Bug Fix: The WordPress version is now correctly sent back to the Sync server, even when a plugin or other modification modifies the version number. This fixes issues with WordPress updates consistently being available, even when it is up-to-date.
1.5.0 - 2014-05-20 - Chris Jean
	Enhancement: Improved feedback when installing themes and plugins.
	Enhancement: Added the ability to install and activate a plugin or theme in one request.
	Bug Fix: Notices generated by mysql_get_server_info() and mysqli_get_server_info() are now hidden and will not fill error logs.
1.5.1 - 2014-06-26 - Chris Jean
	Bug Fix: Users can now properly be synced on sites that report the WordPress version incorrectly.
1.6.0 - 2014-07-01 - Chris Jean
