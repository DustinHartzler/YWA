No. iThemes Sync only works with self-hosted WordPress sites.

= Help! I’m having problems adding a site to Sync. =

iThemes Sync includes an automatic “Add Site" prompt when you first login to the Sync dashboard. If this authentication method fails, try manually installing the iThemes Sync plugin on your WordPress site. Make sure to [create an iThemes account here](https://sync.ithemes.com/signup) and then follow the prompt from the Sync plugin to add your credentials. If you still need help, please open a ticket at the [iThemes Help Desk](https://ithemes.com/support).
