##Contributing to Sensei

Please be sure to follow the guidelines below while contributing:

- When opening an issue please keep it to one bug / enhancement / question etc. this to simplify the discussion.
- All code contributions must be in the form of a pull request.
- All pull requests must be related to an existing / new issue.
- The general rule is to use 1 PR for 1 Issue. This helps the merge master quickly figure out how the new code affects the plugin.
- Going forward we will prefer it if all PR's also include the PHPUnit tests.
